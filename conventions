# Conventions for the lcp-solver project

* All text is markdown-formatted. GFM syntax is fine.
* All communication that leaves a trace is in English.
* We use a shared repo model (push access to both developers).
* All work is done in branches.
* Branches are merged after code review, initiated with a pull request.
* Nothing is merged into the default branch without unit tests.
* Merging into the default branch cannot be carried out by the pull request's initiator.
* Separate math notes with LaTeX formatting are required for all math-related code. Name of the tex file is referenced in the code comments.
